<p>Digital accessibility is one of the key values of this fundraising zine, so we're doing our best to make this website and the final zine accessible for disabled folks. If you run into any issues, please let us know at <a href="mailto:contact@archivezine.org">contact@archivezine.org</a>.<!-- In addition, the theme for <a href="https://www.ica.org/international-archives-week/iaw2025/">International Archives Week 2025</a> is "#ArchivesAreAccessible â€“ Archives for Everyone." This fits both our focus on the Internet Archive and digital accessibility.--></p>
<h2><span class="paper-strip">General Website</span></h2> 
<p>Page language, title, and structure are defined in ways that are available to assistive technologies. Color contrast has been checked with all foreground/background combinations and exceed the WCAG color contrast ratio requirements for text and graphics. Links are descriptive. A skip link is provided to navigate to main content at the start of every page. Keyboard focus is visible on all focusable elements. Pages allow reflow and zoom without requiring users to scroll in two dimensions or obscuring content.</p>
<h2><span class="paper-strip">Form</span></h2>
<p>We're using Zoho for our submission form. We've chosen a theme with adequate color contrast, tested for keyboard accessibility, and done some minor testing with NVDA and Firefox. The main limitation we've noticed is lackluster focus indicators, which we've adjusted as much as we can.</p>
<p>However, we do realize that taking a screenshot of your donation receipt and redacting personal info might not be doable for some folks. If you are unable to take a screenshot of your donation, please email {% include "_accessible_email.html" -%}.</p>
