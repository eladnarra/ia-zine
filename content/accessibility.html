<p>Digital accessibility is one of the key values of this fundraising zine, so we've done our best to make this website and the final zine accessible for disabled folks. If you run into any issues, please let us know at <a href="mailto:contact@archivezine.org">contact@archivezine.org</a>.<!-- In addition, the theme for <a href="https://www.ica.org/international-archives-week/iaw2025/">International Archives Week 2025</a> is "#ArchivesAreAccessible â€“ Archives for Everyone." This fits both our focus on the Internet Archive and digital accessibility.--></p>

<p>We're using Zoho for our submission form. We've chosen a theme with adequate color contrast, tested for keyboard accessibility, and done some minor testing with NVDA and Firefox. The main limitation we've noticed is lackluster focus indicators, which we've adjusted as much as we can.</p>
<p>However, we do realize that taking a screenshot of your donation receipt and redacting personal info might not be doable for some folks. If you are unable to take a screenshot of your donation, please email {% include "_accessible_email.html" -%}.</p>
