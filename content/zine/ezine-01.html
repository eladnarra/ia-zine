<!-- <h2>About</h2>
<p>This zine was created during a fundraiser for the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>. It showcases a tiny fraction of the amazing old websites, books, zines, music, games, and more that are available on the archive (for free!). </p><hr> -->
<h2><span class="paper-strip">What's This Zine?</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> houses an amazing collection of websites, books, zines, music, games, and more, available to the public for free. They catalog changes to websites new and old through their Wayback Machine, and they share media that isn't available elsewhere, like historical 78rpm records.</p>
<p>But the Internet Archive's mission is under threat from record label lawsuits and cyber attacks. As governments take down webpages to erase history and media companies restrict access to our collective culture, their work is more important than ever â€” and they need our support!</p>
<p>In honor of <a href="https://www.ica.org/international-archives-week/iaw2025/">International Archives Week 2025</a>, a group of zinesters, archive fans, and webweavers ran a fundraiser for the Internet Archive. For every donation of $5 or more we found a cool thing in the archive, and at the end we collected all of them into this free (unofficial) zine!</p>
<p>Over the course of the week we raised <strong>${{total}}</strong> from <strong>{{researchItems.length}}</strong> people! Thank you so very much to everyone who donated. And if you missed your chance, you can still <a href="https://archive.org/donate/">donate here</a>.</p>
<p>Let's help keep the Internet Archive alive!</p>
