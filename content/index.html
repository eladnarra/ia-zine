title: Support the Internet Archive!
---

<p>The <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> provides researchers and the public free access to an amazing collection of websites, books, zines, music, games, and more. They catalog changes to websites new and old through their Wayback Machine, and they share media that isn't available elsewhere, like historical 78rpm records.</p>
<p>As governments take down webpages to erase history and media companies restrict access to our collective culture, their work is more important than ever. But their mission is under threat from record label lawsuits and cyber attacks â€” they need our help!</p>
<p><strong>We're running a fundraiser for the Internet Archive from June 9th to June 15th</strong> during <a href="https://www.ica.org/international-archives-week/iaw2025/">International Archives Week 2025</a>. For the first 56 donations of $5 or more, we'll find a cool thing on the Internet Archive. Donors can suggest a topic, and at the end we'll compile everything into a free (unofficial) zine that showcases a small part of what the Internet Archive preserves!</p>
<p>We'll be publishing the accessible HTML zine on this website after the fundraiser, while PDF formats will be hosted on itch.io and the Internet Archive itself!</p>
