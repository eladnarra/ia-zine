title: Support the Internet Archive!
---
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> houses an amazing collection of websites, books, zines, music, games, and more, available to the public for free. They catalog changes to websites new and old through their Wayback Machine, and they share media that isn't available elsewhere, like historical 78rpm records.</p>
<p>But the Internet Archive's mission is under threat from record label lawsuits and cyber attacks. As governments take down webpages to erase history and media companies restrict access to our collective culture, their work is more important than ever â€” and they need our support!</p>
<p><strong>We're running a fundraiser for them during <a href="https://www.ica.org/international-archives-week/iaw2025/">International Archives Week 2025</a> (June 9th to June 15th).</strong> For every donation of $5 or more during International Archives Week , we'll find a cool thing on the Internet Archive. And at the end we'll compile them all into a free zine!</p>
<p>We'll be publishing the HTML zine after the fundraiser on this website, and PDF formats will be hosted on itch.io and the Internet Archive itself!</p>

[Zoho form embed goes here. After paying for a month we can set up a redirect after form submission to the thank you page (in parent window). Can remove instructions from form since they are duplicated above. Should we update title/aria-label? and I guess put the title back on the form, re: https://dequeuniversity.com/tips/provide-iframe-titles]
